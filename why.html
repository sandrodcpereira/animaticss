<h2>What are frame animations?</h2>

<p>Frame animations, as the name implies, have separate frames that, when played in sequence, give the illusion of movement — pretty much like traditional animation from old cartoons.</p>

<p>For Animaticss, animations frames are composed into a long horizontal strip, like film in an old movie.</p>

<p>I’m working on a tool to combine individual frame files, but in the meantime you can use any image editing tool to accomplish this. Remember not to leave any gap between the frames when building the film.</p>

<h2>Why use frame animations?</h2>

<p>If you’re looking to some reasons to use frame animations like these, here’s a few:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>It’s a much more efficient way of storing animations compared to the GIF format.</p></li>
	<li><p>It can be achieved with simple HTML and CSS. This means it has no dependencies — it’s as lightweight as your asset file.</p></li>
	<li><p>You have a lot of control over when the animation plays. You can trigger it only when specific events occur, like on hover or even a button press. See examples here.</p></li>
	<li><p>Only requires one single asset per animation. That’s a lot easier than handling and having to preload multiple assets.</p></li>
	<li><p>Additionally, a single asset can contain multiple animations with some more complex code! Again, check the first example here.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not a bad option for when you’re looking to add some quick and lightweight animations to your projects, right?</p>
